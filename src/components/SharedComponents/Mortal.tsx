/**
 * React Navigation never unmounts a component, leading to weirdly immortal

 * effects open connections or load things and never disconnect them or
 * dispose of them. This component renders its children when it has focus in
 * React Navigation and does not when it loses focus, thereby unmounting
 * those children causing effects to clean up after themselves. Valar
 * Morghulis!
